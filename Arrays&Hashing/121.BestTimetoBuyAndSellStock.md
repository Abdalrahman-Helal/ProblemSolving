# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (LeetCode 121)

## 🧩 Problem Summary
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` represents the stock price on day `i`.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing:
- **one day to buy**
- **a later day to sell**

Return the **maximum profit** you can achieve.  
If no profit is possible, return `0`.

---

## 🧠 My Solution (Initial Approach)

### Idea
- Use two pointers:
  - `L` → buy day
  - `R` → sell day
- If the buy price is higher than the sell price, move `L` forward.
- Calculate profit and track the maximum value.

### Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int L = 0; 
        int max = 0;

        for(int R = 1; R < prices.size(); R++)
        {
            while(prices[L] > prices[R] && L != R)
            {
                L++;
            }

            int tempMax = prices[R] - prices[L];
            if(tempMax > max)
            {
                max = tempMax;
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
};
````

### Complexity

* **Time:** O(n)
* **Space:** O(1)

### Notes

* Correct solution
* Logic is slightly complex due to the `while` loop
* Can be simplified

---

## 🚀 Optimal Solution (Sliding Window)

### Idea

* Track the **minimum price so far** as the buy day.
* Iterate once through the array.
* Update profit when selling price is higher.

### Code

```cpp
int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
    int L = 0;          // buy day
    int maxProfit = 0;

    for (int R = 1; R < prices.size(); R++) {
        if (prices[R] < prices[L]) {
            // better day to buy
            L = R;
        } else {
            // try selling
            maxProfit = max(maxProfit, prices[R] - prices[L]);
        }
    }

    return maxProfit;
}
```

### Complexity

* **Time:** O(n)
* **Space:** O(1)

### Why This Is Optimal

* Single pass
* Clean and readable logic
* Classic sliding window pattern

## ✅ Key Takeaway ☝

Always track the **lowest buying price so far**, and try to sell at higher prices later.
