# Two Sum

## 🧩 Problem Description
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return **indices of the two numbers** such that they add up to `target`.

- Each input has **exactly one solution**
- You may not use the same element twice
- The answer can be returned in **any order**

## 💡 Approach (Hash Map)

We use an `unordered_map` to store each number and its index while iterating through the array.

### Steps:
1. Traverse the array once.
2. For each element `nums[i]`, compute the difference:
   ```
   diff = target - nums[i]
   ```
3. Check if `diff` already exists in the map:
   - If yes → solution found.
   - If no → store `nums[i]` with its index.
4. Return the indices when found.

This approach avoids nested loops and achieves optimal performance.

## ✅ C++ Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        unordered_map<int, int> umap;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            int diff = target - nums[i];

            if (umap.count(diff)) {
                return { umap[diff], i };
            }

            umap.insert({ nums[i], i });
        }

        return {};
    }
};
```

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`

## 📝 Notes
- This is the **optimal solution** for the Two Sum problem.
- Uses a single pass through the array.
- Suitable for coding interviews and competitive programming.
