# LeetCode 424 - Longest Repeating Character Replacement (Visual Trace)

## Example
```
s = "AABABBA"
k = 1
```

---

## Core Idea
We maintain a sliding window and check this condition:

```
window_size - maxFreq <= k
```

- `window_size = r - l + 1`
- `maxFreq` = highest frequency of a single character inside the current window
- If true → window is valid
- If false → shrink the window from the left

---

## Initialization
```
l = 0
maxFreq = 0
maxLength = 0
freq[26] = {0}
```

---

## Step-by-Step Trace

### r = 0 → 'A'
```
freq[A] = 1
maxFreq = 1
window = "A"
window_size = 1
1 - 1 = 0 <= 1  (Valid)
```
maxLength = 1

---

### r = 1 → 'A'
```
freq[A] = 2
maxFreq = 2
window = "AA"
window_size = 2
2 - 2 = 0 <= 1  (Valid)
```
maxLength = 2

---

### r = 2 → 'B'
```
freq[B] = 1
maxFreq = 2
window = "AAB"
window_size = 3
3 - 2 = 1 <= 1  (Valid)
```
maxLength = 3

---

### r = 3 → 'A'
```
freq[A] = 3
maxFreq = 3
window = "AABA"
window_size = 4
4 - 3 = 1 <= 1  (Valid)
```
maxLength = 4  ⭐

---

### r = 4 → 'B'
```
freq[B] = 2
window = "AABAB"
window_size = 5
5 - 3 = 2 > 1  (Invalid)
```

Now we shrink the window from the left.

---

### Shrink Step 1 (l = 0, remove 'A')
```
freq[A] = 2
l = 1
window = "ABAB"
window_size = 4
4 - 2 = 2 > 1  (Still Invalid)
```

---

### Shrink Step 2 (l = 1, remove 'A')
```
freq[A] = 1
l = 2
window = "BAB"
window_size = 3
3 - 2 = 1 <= 1  (Valid)
```

maxLength remains = 4

---

## Key Takeaways
- We do NOT actually replace characters in the string.
- We only check if replacements needed ≤ k.
- `maxFreq` tracks the most frequent character in the current window.
- Sliding window expands with `r` and shrinks with `l`.
- Each character is processed at most twice.

---

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(26) ≈ O(1)

---

## Why Frequency Array?
```
vector<int> freq(26, 0);
```
- Index 0 → 'A'
- Index 1 → 'B'
- ...
- Index 25 → 'Z'

This allows O(1) frequency updates:
```
freq[s[r] - 'A']++;
```
