# Container With Most Water

**LeetCode Problem URL:** https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

---

## 🧠 Problem Description

You are given an integer array `height` where each element represents the height of a vertical line drawn on the x-axis.

- The index of the array represents the x-coordinate.
- The value at each index represents the height of a vertical line.

Choose **two different lines** such that together with the x-axis they form a container that can hold the **maximum amount of water**.

### ⚠️ Important Notes
- You cannot tilt the container.
- The water amount is limited by the **shorter line**.

## 🧾 Code Implementation (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int area = 0;
        int maxArea = 0;
        int l = 0;
        int r = height.size() - 1;

        while (l < r) {
            area = (r - l) * min(height[l], height[r]);
            maxArea = max(area, maxArea);

            if (height[l] > height[r]) {
                r--;
            } else {
                l++;
            }
        }

        return maxArea;
    }
};
```

## 📐 How Area Is Calculated

For two indices `l` and `r`:

```
Area = (r - l) × min(height[l], height[r]) 
```

---

## 💡 Idea Behind the Solution (Two Pointers)

- Start with two pointers:
  - `l` at the beginning (index `0`)
  - `r` at the end (last index)
- Calculate the area between them.
- Update the maximum area found so far.
- Move the pointer that has the **smaller height**:
  - Because the smaller height is the limiting factor.

This guarantees an **O(n)** time complexity.

## 🧪 Example

### Input
```
height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
```

### Output
```
49
```

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Trace (Pointer Visualization)

```
Input:
height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
index   =  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
```

---

### Step 1
```
[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
 L               R
```
- width = 8 - 0 = 8
- height = min(1, 7) = 1
- area = 8 × 1 = 8
- max_area = 8
- Move **L** (1 < 7)

---

### Step 2
```
[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
   L             R
```
- width = 8 - 1 = 7
- height = min(8, 7) = 7
- area = 7 × 7 = 49
- max_area = 49
- Move **R** (7 < 8)

---

### Step 3
```
[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
   L           R
```
- width = 7 - 1 = 6
- height = min(8, 3) = 3
- area = 6 × 3 = 18
- max_area = 49
- Move **R**

---

### Step 4
```
[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
   L         R
```
- width = 6 - 1 = 5
- height = min(8, 8) = 8
- area = 5 × 8 = 40
- max_area = 49
- Heights equal → move either (move **L**)

---

### Step 5
```
[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
     L       R
```
- width = 6 - 2 = 4
- height = min(6, 8) = 6
- area = 4 × 6 = 24
- max_area = 49
- Move **L**

---

### Step 6
```
[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
       L     R
```
- width = 6 - 3 = 3
- height = min(2, 8) = 2
- area = 3 × 2 = 6
- max_area = 49
- Move **L**

---

### Step 7
```
[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
         L   R
```
- width = 6 - 4 = 2
- height = min(5, 8) = 5
- area = 2 × 5 = 10
- max_area = 49
- Move **L**

---

### Step 8
```
[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
           L R
```
- width = 6 - 5 = 1
- height = min(4, 8) = 4
- area = 1 × 4 = 4
- max_area = 49
- Move **L**

---

### Stop Condition
```
[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
             L
             R
```
- L == R → stop

---

### ✅ Final Answer
**49**

---

## ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- Brute force would be `O(n²)` → too slow.
- Two pointers reduce it to `O(n)`.
- Always move the pointer with the **smaller height**.
