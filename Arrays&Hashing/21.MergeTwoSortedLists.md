## Problem Description

Given two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`, merge them into one sorted linked list. The resulting list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

### Example

**Input:**
```
list1: 1 -> 3 -> 5
list2: 2 -> 4 -> 6
```

**Output:**
```
Merged list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
```

## C++ Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* mergeTwoLists(ListNode* list1, ListNode* list2) {
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);  // Dummy node as anchor
        ListNode* cur = dummy;              // Current pointer for building the merged list

        // Traverse both lists and attach the smaller node to cur->next
        while (list1 && list2) {
            if (list1->val > list2->val) {
                cur->next = list2;
                list2 = list2->next;
            } else {
                cur->next = list1;
                list1 = list1->next;
            }
            cur = cur->next;
        }

        // Attach remaining nodes from the non-empty list
        cur->next = list1 ? list1 : list2;

        ListNode* head = dummy->next;  // First real node
        delete dummy;                  // Delete dummy to prevent memory leak
        return head;
    }
};
```

## How It Works

1. Create a dummy node to simplify handling of the head node.
2. Use a pointer `cur` to build the merged list.
3. Compare nodes from `list1` and `list2`, attach the smaller node to `cur->next`.
4. Move `cur` forward and the chosen list's pointer forward.
5. After one list is exhausted, attach the remaining nodes from the other list.
6. Return `dummy->next` as the head of the merged list.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two lists.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), only pointers are used, no additional memory for nodes.

## Usage

This code can be used as part of any C++ project dealing with linked lists. Simply include the `ListNode` definition and the `Solution` class in your project.
